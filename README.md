# vertex_cover_problem

## Construct Graph
Code expects a series of inputs:
Combination of a pair of vertices which can signify a line

Output:An undirected graph with vertices and edges

## Find Shortest Path
Expects a series of inputs in a specific format:
Number of vertices Pair of edges start and end vertex

Output: shortest path in an undirected graph from starting vertex to end vertex.

Code runs till EOF is reached.
